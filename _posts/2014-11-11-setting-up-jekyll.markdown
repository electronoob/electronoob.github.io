*WOW*, where do I start?

I decided to give Jekyll a go, so tonight, I have spent hours learning about it's configuration, tweaking settings, designing the 
appearance, etc... It's surprising to me that the learning curve for this was moderately steep but overal very much worth it.

When I preview the site however I do see this in my terminal:

  NOTE *BSD SUPPORT IS EXPERIMENTAL!

  In fact, it likely WONT WORK!!!!

But fortunately for me it works well enough!

I'm too tired right now to write anything else.. Hello 4am!
